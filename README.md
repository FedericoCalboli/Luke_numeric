# Luke_numeric
Documentation for the Luke_numeric CSL style

The style is meant to be used in Horizon Europe or other grant applications, providing a style that takes up the most limited amount of space possible, due to the constraints on page number of grant applications. Briefly the idea is to have all the references as superscripts in the text, and in the bibliography they follow these rules:

If one author, "Surname"
 
If two authors, "Surname & Surname"
 
If three or more authors, "Surname et al."
 
The abbreviated journal name is italic, without full stops to show the abbreviations
 
The volume number is bold
 
No need for an issue number
 
Page range doesn't include any commas for indicating thousands, and the hyphen is a short dash (not an en or em dash)
